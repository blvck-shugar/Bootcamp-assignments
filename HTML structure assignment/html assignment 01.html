 <p>YouTube Ads, everyone knows they are annoying and getting longer with 
every update the app undergoes but my experience with YouTube ads is just 
about the same as everyone until the 19th of January 2020 when an ad popped up 
at the middle of a life hack video I was streaming on the app, at first glance I 
couldn’t wait for the countdown to end so I could go back to the life hacks I was 
streaming; then something caught my eyes, it was a video of a kid writing an 
endless stream of codes with lightning speed. Seeing those codes line up 
beautifully on the note editor, I knew I wanted to be able to do that just as 
seamless as the kid in the ad. So, I clicked on the link and registered for their 
online course at Shaw academy, thinking back now I don’t think I ever went back 
to finishing that life hack video on YouTube. Programming is something I have 
grown to love immensely but didn’t know I loved it, I just needed a nudge in the 
right direction and the AD did the magic.
Humans are pattern-matching machines, to solve problems we draw upon 
previous experiences to identify possible solutions. Languages were developed 
from matching patterns and the human innate desire to relate with one another. 
Programming languages are not so different, they are another form language 
mankind has invented only difference is, it was not made to relate to people but 
to relate to machines. A programming language is a set of instruction, syntax, 
and commands used to create a software program. Programmers use high level 
languages to write codes, this code can be compiled into low level language 
which the computer hardware recognizes. High level languages are used in most 
major programming languages and are designed to be easy to read and understand, this allows programmers to write source codes in natural fashion. 
High level languages include C++, PHP and Java. Low level languages include 
assembly and machine language, an assembly language contains a list of basic 
instructions and is much more difficult to read than a high-level language
